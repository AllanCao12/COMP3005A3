Functions: 
getAllStudents: Retrieves and displays all records from the students table and prints them to the console
addStudents: Adds a student to the students table
updateStudentEmail: Updates a student's email

Steps: Have a SQL database open, have a database called a3, change the passwords to what yours is for the connect() functions, and run your code normally. 

I included some testing code at the bottom if you want to use it during marking. It's also the code I use in my video. (you can use ctrl+/ on Windows to uncomment all of it)
